                    I am pursuing my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering.Writing was once my hobby but now it's my passion.
                    <br>I've written one solo book and four anthologies. Among the four anthologies two got published and remaining two anthologies will be published soon.
                    I strongly believe that, following our passion<br>will definitely give us satisfaction and happiness. Because I haven't dreamt of becoming a writer but now I'm the author of one book and coauthor of four other books.
                    Apart from this, I love cooking,<br>dancing, listening to music and playing shuttle cock. Having many hobbies is a better way to be relaxed.
My dream is to make people optimistic and I wish them to be a fervid and tenacious person too.</i></p>
